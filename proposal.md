# Proposal 

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Icon Memory Matching!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive game to match icons or symbols with each other. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will present a grid of tiles (roughly 6x6 and may increase with each level) and there will be different, hidden icons behind each tile. After each tile is clicked, it will reveal what is underneath. After the user selects 2 tiles and it is NOT a match, the program will have the user try again until it makes a match. Once it has a pair, the tile will remain unrevealed and the user will have to repeat this process until all the icons are matched. The number of mistakes and the number of moves/clicked will be counted (possibly make a ranking for least amount of moves). We may use pygame to execute it, and will make use of sprite sheets to make the visuals more appealing and fun. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Counting the number of moves and the nummber of mistakes 

Having the user reveal what is underneath each tile.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- I believe we can at the very least create the game and be able to count the numbe of moves and mistakes along with a standard grid UI 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- As above but instead of a standard grid UI, creating and designing a more visually appealing and impressive UI would be the goal

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- Our next steps will start by first finalizing what engine we want to use to create our game (Unity, Unreal, or Pygame). In terms of the skillset that we need to acquire, we need to learn how to be able each portion of the game come together (the icons, the flipping of the tiles, keeping track of what the user has flipped over, determining if the user inputs are correct, etc.) We will need to research things such as sprite sheets and determine which ones we want, or if that is something even applicable to our vision. As far as who will complete what tasts, that is something we still need to determine after laying out our collective vision and creative ideas as well as comparing our current skillsets before we delegate specific tasts to eachother.
